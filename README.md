# Angular-Material-Electron
A skeleton for making electron apps in Angular Material

See the Electron Quick Start [here](https://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start/)
See the Angular Quick Start [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-material)

This repo is simply a merger of the two, with a controller added for good measure. 

To use, clone the repo and run ``npm install`` in the directory, then run ``./node_modules/.bin/electron .`` on \*nix or ``.\node_modules\.bin\electron .`` on windows.
